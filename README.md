## Tune Town

Tune town is an app designed to catalog your favorite music. There's no worse feeling than forgetting the name of that band or song you recently heard. Now when you do find music you enjoy, you can add that band, album, or song to your personal catalog of music so you never forget again. Curate your list of favorite music, edit that list, and comment on other user's catalog, telling them how horrible their taste in music is!

This app will be using either Discogs' API (this API has more features but is more of a pain to connect tto) or the Audio DB API (easier connectivity, but less data to pull from).
